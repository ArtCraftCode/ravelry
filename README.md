# Ravelry

The Ruby gem for accessing the Ravelry API painlessly, easily, and awesomely. Made by a knitter, knitwear designer, and hacker all rolled into one sassy woman so you know it's good (ish).

Ravelry API documentation is currently available [here](http://www.ravelry.com/api).

Current API routes covered include:

* `Patterns#show` (`GET`)

*Want a route that isn't currently covered? [Request it](https://github.com/feministy/ravelry/issues) by submitting an issue.*

# Installation

Welcome to a magical land where gems rule the world. To install, type:

```
gem install ravelry
```

Hooray! You now have a gem.

Add to your `Gemfile`:

```
gem "ravelry"
```

And set up your environment variables:

* `RAV_ACCESS` - your Ravelry access key
* `RAV_SECRET` - your Ravelry secret key
* `RAV_PERSONAL` - wait for it! Your Ravelry personal key; primarily used for OAuth

Getting these keys requires a (free) Ravelry account and that you agree to the terms of use for the API.

# Usage

Documentation is available [here](#).

### Accessing pattern ids (for `Ravelry::Patterns`)

Navigate to a pattern page in Ravelry and open up the JavaScript console. Type this in:

```javascript
$$('.difficulty').first().id
```

You should see something like this: ```"pattern_419443_difficulty_score"```.

```419443``` is your pattern id.

### Conventions

This gem makes use of several conventions that are worth noting on a global scale.

#### Minimal data manipulation

Unless specifically noted in the documentation, the data returned from the API call is not manipulated. Data is fetched and parsed, but is only processed in instances where multiple formats would be helpful. Even if the data is manipulated, the original format is always available using some other method.

#### Method names ending with `_count` return integers.

Example:

```ruby
pattern = Ravelry::Patterns.new("000000")
pattern.comments_count
# => 4
```

#### Method names ending with `_float`, `_integer`, etc return that object type.

Float to Integer conversions are done using round(0).

Example:

```ruby
pattern = Ravelry::Patterns.new("000000")
pattern.difficulty_average_float
# => 4.666666667

pattern.difficulty_average_integer
# => 5
```
