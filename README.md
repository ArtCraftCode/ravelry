# Installation

To install, type:

```
gem install ravelry
```

Hooray! You now have a gem.

Add to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "ravelry", "~> 0.0.8"
```

**I highly recommend pinning your version** because the gem is in active development and small changes and additions will be made regularly.

Run `bundle install` and proceed as usual.

# Configuration

API keys *must* be configured in the gem setup. You can do this anywhere in your application before you make API calls using the gem.

```ruby
Ravelry.configure do |config|
  config.access_key = ''
  config.secret_key = ''
  config.personal_key = ''
end
```

* `config.access_key` - your Ravelry access key
* `config.secret_key` - your Ravelry secret key
* `config.personal_key` - wait for it! Your Ravelry personal key; primarily used for OAuth (not yet implemented in the gem)

Getting these keys requires a (free) Ravelry account and that you agree to the terms of use for the API.

The keys are available to you throughout your application as:

```ruby
Ravelry.configuration.access_key
Ravelry.configuration.secret_key
Ravelry.configuration.personal_key
```

# Usage

Full documentation for this gem is available [here](http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/ravelry/0.0.8).

# Conventions

This gem makes use of several conventions that are worth noting on a global scale.

## Method names ending with `_count` return integers.

Example:

```ruby
pattern.comments_count
# => 4
```

## Method names ending with `_float`, `_integer`, etc return that object type.

Float to Integer conversions are done using round(0).

Example:

```ruby
pattern.difficulty_average_float
# => 4.666666667

pattern.difficulty_average_integer
# => 5
```

Send me a pull request! Please write tests, **documentation** for your code (the test part kind of goes without saying, but I wanted to make sure that you knew about it and the documentation), and update the changelog with your additions under the next unreleased version.

To run specs locally, simply `bundle` and then run `rpsec`.
