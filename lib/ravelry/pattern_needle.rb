  # The information used to create `Ravelry::PatternNeedle` currently comes from {Ravelry::Pattern} objects.
  # 
  # You should not need to create `PatterNeedle` objects manually; they are all created–and owned by–by a {Ravelry::Pattern}.
  # 
  # Note that there are other API endpoints for Needles; this might not be the one that you're looking for.
  # 
  # See {Ravelry::Pattern} for more information about `Pattern` objects.
